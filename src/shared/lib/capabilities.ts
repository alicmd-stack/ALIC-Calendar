/**
 * Capability resolution for the Members and Kids Ministry modules.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `public.user_organizations` has UNIQUE(user_id, organization_id), so a user
 * holds exactly ONE `app_role` per branch. Adding kids roles to that enum
 * would take away someone's `treasury` or `contributor`. Module permissions
 * are therefore additive rows in `church.module_grants`, resolved here into a
 * flat capability set the UI can gate on.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT THE SECURITY BOUNDARY.
 * Hiding a button is not authorization. Every capability below has a matching
 * RLS policy or SECURITY DEFINER RPC check in the database, and that is what
 * actually enforces access. This module exists so the UI does not offer
 * actions that will fail, and so route gating is testable.
 *
 * Everything here is pure — no React, no Supabase — so it runs in the node
 * test environment.
