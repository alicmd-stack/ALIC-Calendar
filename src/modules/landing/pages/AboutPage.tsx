              Addis Lidet Church began as a small gathering in Washington, DC,
              in 2008. In 2009, the church moved to Silver Spring, Maryland,
              where it grew steadily in membership and ministry over the next
              decade. Through seasons of growth and challenge, God's
              faithfulness and provision remained central to the church's
              journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2014, weekday worship and prayer gatherings in Arlington,
              Virginia, became the foundation for what is now the Addis Lidet
              Church Virginia location. What began with two home cells has since
              expanded into a growing network of small groups across Virginia
              and Maryland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Addis Lidet Church serves more than 1,000 congregants
              across its Silver Spring, Maryland, and Alexandria, Virginia,
              locations.

            strengthening our community from the inside out. Over the next five
            years, we are dedicated to transforming church attendance into true
            discipleship through thriving home cell networks, robust family
            empowerment, and dynamic next-generation ministries that equip our
            children and youth for life-long faith and discipleship.
          </p>
          <p>
            This roadmap drives us to expand our reach and allocate resources
            accordingly to support these ministries. With the help and guidance
            of the Holy Spirit, we are prayerfully committed to serving His
            Kingdom with dedication and commitment.
