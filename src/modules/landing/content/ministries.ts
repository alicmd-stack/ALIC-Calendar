/**
 * Ministries content config
 * -------------------------
 * Single source of truth for the Ministries page.
 *
 * Editing rules:
 *  - Every public string lives here as { en, am }. Amharic ('am') is optional —
 *    if missing, the page renders English in both languages.
 *  - `published: false` hides a ministry from the page entirely. Set it true
 *    only after the listed [VERIFY] items have been confirmed with leadership.
 *  - Do NOT invent leader names, emails, photos, or testimonial quotes.
 *    Leave them null/empty — the layout handles missing fields.
 *
 * Verification status reflects ALIC's prompt of record (April 2026).
 * See MINISTRIES.md at the repo root for the full pre-launch checklist.
