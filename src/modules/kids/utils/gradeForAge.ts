/**
 * Suggesting a classroom for a child nobody has met before.
 *
 * ALIC's ten classrooms are keyed to SCHOOL GRADE — Joy A is Pre-K, Redeemed C
 * is Grade 8 — so grade, not age band, is what actually decides where a child
 * sits. The five age bands are far too coarse to help: "Elementary (5-10)"
 * spans six grades and five different rooms.
 *
 * A visiting family has no grade on file, which is why placement fell through
 * to "the emptiest open room, any grade" and a four-year-old could land in
 * Grade 8. The desk knows one thing about a visiting child within seconds of
 * asking — roughly how old they are — so that is what this turns into a
 * starting point.
 *
 * IT IS A SUGGESTION, NOT A DECISION. Held-back years, skipped years, birthdays
 * that fall the wrong side of the cutoff, and families new to the US school
 * system all make the arithmetic wrong for a real child. The volunteer picks
 * the class; this only decides which option is already selected when the
 * dropdown opens.
 *
 * THE ARITHMETIC. US convention: a child is 5 in Kindergarten, 6 in Grade 1,
 * and so on to 13 in Grade 8; Pre-K is 4. Grades run from the autumn, so from
 * August onward a child is treated as being in the year they are about to
 * start rather than the one they have just finished.
 *
 * Only birth YEAR is on file — the plan dropped day-of-month deliberately — so
 * the age here is an approximation and the September cutoff cannot be applied
 * exactly. That is a further reason this is a default and not an assignment.
