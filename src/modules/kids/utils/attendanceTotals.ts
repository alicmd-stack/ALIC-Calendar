/**
 * Totals for the attendance report.
 *
 * church.kids_attendance_report returns one row per room per service, and
 * nothing anywhere added them up — a leader asking "how many children came on
 * Sunday" had to do it in their head across eleven rooms.
 *
 * WHAT MAY BE SUMMED, AND WHAT MAY NOT. The report's own grouping decides
 * this, and getting it wrong produces a number that looks authoritative and
 * is not:
 *
 *   children             count(DISTINCT child) per session+room. A child holds
 *                        exactly one open check-in per session
 *                        (uq_kids_check_ins_one_active_per_session) and a
 *                        transfer UPDATEs the room rather than adding a row,
 *                        so summing ACROSS ROOMS within a service is exact.
 *   volunteers           count(DISTINCT person) per session+room, and
 *                        uq_kids_staffing_one_active allows one active row per
 *                        person per session, so again exact across rooms.
 *   overrides,           plain count(*) over check-in rows. Always summable.
 *   not_checked_out
 *   avg_minutes          an AVERAGE. Summing it is meaningless and averaging
 *                        the averages weights a room of two the same as a room
 *                        of thirty, so it is weighted by `children` here.
 *
 * ACROSS SERVICES IS THE ONE THAT IS NOT EXACT. A child at both the 9:00 and
 * the 11:00 is two check-ins and counts twice in a day that has two services.
 * That is the right answer for "how many children did we look after today" and
 * the wrong one for "how many different children came". ALIC runs one service
 * a date today, so the two coincide, but the schema allows more — so the group
 * carries `serviceCount` and the screen says so rather than quietly picking a
 * meaning.
