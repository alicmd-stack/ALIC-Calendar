 *   check_out         — "Noah was collected at 11:42"
 *   volunteer_message — "Please report to Children's Ministry Room 4"
 *
 * The first two are written by triggers on church.kids_check_ins; the third by

 * hours) and after a check-in for immediacy. It is safe to run concurrently:
 * rows are claimed with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, so an overlapping run picks up
 * different rows rather than sending the same message twice.
