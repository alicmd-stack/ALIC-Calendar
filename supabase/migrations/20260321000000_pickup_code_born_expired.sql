-- =====================================================
-- A pickup code must not be born expired
-- =====================================================
--
-- Every code minted this weekend was already expired when it printed. The desk
-- said "That code was not recognised" for a code that was completely correct.
--
--   code_hash matched          -- the code was right
--   consumed_at IS NULL        -- it had not been used
--   locked_until IS NULL       -- it was not locked out
--   expires_at 09:29:27.720847 -- and now() was 17:02
--
-- The cause is the anchor. check_in_children set
--
--     expires_at := ks.ends_at + interval '4 hours'
--
-- which is the session's PLANNED end, decided when the session was opened. The
-- session auto-opened at 02:29 UTC — 10:29pm the previous evening in Maryland —
-- so ends_at landed at 01:29 and every code issued after 05:29 was stamped with
-- an expiry in the past. The microseconds gave it away: .720847 on the expiry
-- is byte-identical to .720847 on the session's opened_at.
--
-- resolve_pickup treats expiry exactly like a wrong code — deliberately, so the
-- desk cannot be used as an oracle — which is why this looked like a bad code
-- for two days.
--
-- greatest(ks.ends_at, now()) keeps the intent, which is four hours of grace
-- after the service ends, while making the guarantee that actually matters: a
-- code is valid for at least four hours from the moment it is ISSUED. A child
-- who is in a room right now must be collectable, whatever the calendar says
-- about when the service was supposed to finish.
--
-- This does not fix the reason ends_at was wrong — the auto-open cron reckons
-- "today" in UTC, so it opens Sunday's session at 8pm on Saturday, Eastern.
-- That is a separate defect and is left for a deliberate decision about the
-- church's timezone. The guarantee above holds regardless of it.
